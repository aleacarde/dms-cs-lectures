# Implement The IntegerNumber Class To Represent An Integer Number And The Possible Operations On It
# In A Similar Way To How Tao Does It In His Book. 
# Try To See If You Can Construct An Integer Using The NaturalNumber Class From Lecture
class IntegerNumber:

# TODO Exercise 2:
# Implement IntegerNumbers To Represent The Set Of All Integer Numbers
# Hint: You don't need to go in only one direction, you could generate the numberes like this 0 -1, 1, -2, 2, ...
# Hint 2: Perhaps there is a way you could use the NaturalNumbers class to do it... I would try both that and only using 
#         the IntegerNumber class, just to make sure that your comprehension is thoroughly checked.

# Challenge: But how would you iterate over them in the right order in that case?! Is there some kind of pattern you can expoit?
#            If so, then implement that and write a loop to print from -10 to 10 in order!
